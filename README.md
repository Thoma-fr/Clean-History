# Clean-History

**Clean-History** is a solo VR sandbox gore game where you play a fired temporal cleaner out for revenge.  
Sabotage your former employer by creating pure chaos: smash, cut, burn, and drench everything in blood before security arrives. Get things as filthy as possible and rack up a massive score!

In the world of Clean-History, the company *Clean History* is a temporal agency whose mission is to travel back in time and erase scenes from history that should never have existed.

You’ve been working hard for the company for six years, earning “Employee of the Year” multiple times and never counting your overtime, until you’ve piled up hundreds of hours.  
One day, your bosses decide to fire you overnight before the overtime bill gets too high. That’s the last straw. No more cleaning — it’s payback time.

We’re running out of time, so we have to break, burn, dirty, and cut up everything we can!
